## Database Tasks

### Update Row Level Security (RLS):
Modify the existing RLS policies for the profiles table to ensure that only authenticated users can view their profiles.
Create a policy that restricts access to the profiles table, allowing only users who are logged in to see their own profile data.

### Review Other Tables:
Check other tables in the database for similar RLS requirements and update them as necessary.
